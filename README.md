## Revisiting performance metrics for prediction with rare outcomes
### 

Supplemental material for the paper, "Revisiting performance metrics for prediction with rare outcomes" by Samrachana Adhikari, Sharon-Lise Normand, Jordan Bloom, David Shahian, and Sherri Rose.

Organization of the repository is as follows:

- **SimulatedData**: A subfolder with simulated data used in the paper for one of the cohorts under all three conditions.
- **SimulationStudy**: A subfolder with .R scripts to fit super learner algorithms on the simulated data and to summarize fitted models.
- **SLwrappersAVR.R**: A .R file with new super learner wrapper functions and functions for computing performance metrics.
