## Revisiting Performance Metrics for Prediction with Rare Outcomes
### 

Code and simulated data for the paper "Revisiting Performance Metrics for Prediction with Rare Outcomes" in *Statistical Methods in Medical Research* by Samrachana Adhikari, Sharon-Lise Normand, Jordan Bloom, David Shahian, and Sherri Rose (2021), [doi:10.1177/09622802211038754](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09622802211038754).

Organization of the repository is as follows:

- **SimulatedData**: A subfolder with simulated data used in the paper for one of the cohorts under all three conditions as well as for different event rates.
- **SimulationStudy**: A subfolder with .R scripts to fit super learner algorithms on the simulated data and to summarize fitted algorithms.
- **SLwrappersAVR.R**: A .R file with new super learner wrapper functions and functions for computing performance metrics.
