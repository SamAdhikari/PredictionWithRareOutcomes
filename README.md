## Revisiting performance metrics for prediction with rare outcomes
### - Samrachana Adhikari, Sharon-Lise Normand, Sherri Rose

In this repository we share codes used to run simulations in the paper "Revisiting performance metrics for prediction with rare outcomes".

Organization of the repository is as follows:

- **SLwrappersAVR.R**: A .R file with new super learner wrapper functions, and functions for computing performance metrics.
- **SimulatedData**: a subfolder with simulated data used in the paper for one of the cohorts under all 3 conditions.
- **SimulationStudy**: a subfolder with .R scripts to fit super learner algorithms on the simulated data and to summarize fitted models.
