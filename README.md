## Revisiting Performance Metrics for Prediction with Rare Outcomes
### 

Code and simulated data for the paper "Revisiting Performance Metrics for Prediction with Rare Outcomes" by Samrachana Adhikari, Sharon-Lise Normand, Jordan Bloom, David Shahian, and Sherri Rose.

Organization of the repository is as follows:

- **SimulatedData**: A subfolder with simulated data used in the paper for one of the cohorts under all three conditions.
- **SimulationStudy**: A subfolder with .R scripts to fit super learner algorithms on the simulated data and to summarize fitted algorithms.
- **SLwrappersAVR.R**: A .R file with new super learner wrapper functions and functions for computing performance metrics.
